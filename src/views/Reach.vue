        <p class="text-gray-400">Outreach workers provide support, referrals and education to individuals in need across
          Australia. They work
          for different organisations such as The Court Network, SESLHD and others. They often undergo a high degree of
          training and work closely with others to improve outreach skills. With 62,200 Australian currently employed as
          Welfare Support Workers (Australian Government Job Outlook, 2020) and many of them conducting outreach, this is
          a significant financial burden for the organisations involved.

          outreach worker
          managerial staff, helped me understand what issues they faced. Gaining both perspectives, I believed, was vital
          to creating a design solution which could be realistically implemented and also address user needs.

            <span class="text-sm">
              There are many benefits for outreach workers by facilitating the flow of information between different
              organisations. Although not always appropriate, facilitating information and training for outreach workers
              could enhance the rate at which outreach workers are successful in providing outreach and could improve
              factors such as communication styles, conflict resolution and knowledge sharing.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li class=" text-lg mb-6"><span class="text-gray-300">Create more opportunities for understanding</span><br>
            <span class="text-sm">
              Reflective practices can be effective for outreach. Indeed, due to many outreach workers dealing with
              complex situations, allowing outreach workers to have more opportunities about how to approach situations,
              why some interactions were better than others, and what can be done in future could assist workers
              significantly. This could have the impact of allowing workers to reach more clients more effectively.

          <li class=" text-lg mb-6"><span class="text-gray-300">Providing outreach can be complex</span><br>
            <span class="text-sm">
              Outreach method which benefits one group - such as using virtual information distribution - may not
              necessarily benefit another. For instance, many indigenous groups use technology to lesser degree, in which
              case, distributing virtual resources would be ineffective. Indeed, not every tool or resource will be
              appropriate for every outreach worker, so ensuring the right resources and trainings get to the right
              workers will be a key consideration.

          This redesign resulted garnered positive feedback from the team, with the initial stakeholders and
          organisational leaders at NSW Health and The Court Outreach Network expressing positive feedback for its
          potential to transform their organisation. I really enjoyed creating this project and it helped emphasise the
          importance of research and going wide with the problem before creating focus in design.
