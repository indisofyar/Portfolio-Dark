      <p class="mb-2">
        I aim to create great products which create great experiences for and are highly accessible to a wide range of users.
        I'm interested in finding intersections of technical feasibility,
        human needs and viability for the organisation.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Previously I've worked as a graphic designer to deliver quality
        assets for Wisr and also worked at NSW Health to deliver health
        resources for young people as well as facilitated focus groups and
        webinars for health organisations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Outside of this, I'm passionate about food, cooking and exploring a
        city's restaurant scene and love indie video games and 80's horror
        movies.
