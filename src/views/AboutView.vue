        <p class="mb-4">
          I'm currently enjoying working as a UX designer & developer at MyPocketSkill. Previously I've worked as a
          graphic designer at a fintech and worked with young people & conducted focus groups at NSW Health.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I love the challenge of delivering high quality products which people <u
            class="decoration-blue-600">actually want to use</u>, and discovering intersections of user needs, business
          goals and visual design.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Outside of work, I'm passionate about food, cooking and exploring a
          city's restaurant scene and love indie video games and 80's horror
          movies.
