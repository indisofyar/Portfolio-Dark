          I'm interested in creating enjoyable usable products and collaborating with teams to ensure that they are feasible and
          can be delivered on time.
          <!-- I aim to create great products which create great experiences for and are highly accessible to a wide range of users.
        I'm interested in finding intersections of technical feasibility,
        human needs and viability for the organisation. -->
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I'm currently enjoying working as a designer & developer at MyPocketSkill. Previously I've  worked as a
          graphic designer at a fintech and worked with young people & conducted focus groups at NSW Health.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Outside of work, I'm passionate about food, cooking and exploring a
          city's restaurant scene and love indie video games and 80's horror
          movies.
